# Skill Hub

## Domain 

The project is a mobile application developed in Flutter using Dart as a programming language, wireframe as UI and Firestore as backend server. This app can be operated in both iOS and Android  

## Idea

The idea of the project is as an intra-organizational employment-oriented service that operates via mobile apps. 
The organization that we have used as a test case is BIT Mesra, however, it can be oriented towards any other organization as well. The main goal is to bring convenience to freelancers and startups to hire people from within the community from where they are based.<br />
The app can be very useful to foster expirence of networking to those who has no prior industry exprence and also to those looking for a cost competative employbility from within their organizational structure. 

# Achievements

3. The app provides for a basket so that the user can select multiple people at one time without having to go through the same process recursively. 
4.  The app also provides for payment gateway so that the user doesn't have to deal with the hassle of negotiation and engage with third party payments procedure. 
5.  The user also has the feature of deleting any of this selection from the Cart/Basket page if he/she reconsiders their decesion.
